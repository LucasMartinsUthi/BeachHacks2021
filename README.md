# BeachHacks2021
Our winner project from "Best UI/UX" from BeachHacks 2021

Project name: I hate this website

Members: Arthur Zelindro, Lucas Martins, Tony Froes

Inspiration
Our idea came based on the video 'Animator vs Animation', when we thought of one trying to destroy the other and we thought it would be fun to create something like that . At first we thought about an application, but with 2 of the group members they had no knowledge in web development, we wanted to go this way to generate the opportunity to learn while we program. And finally, we came up with the idea of ​​'Destroy this site'.

What it does
Its a site that has tools in which the user can destroy it in any way they prefers.

How we built it
We built the site using Bootstrap for the front-end and Javascript with Matter.js library to calculate the collisions, and physics in general.

Challenges we ran into
Our main problems happened around the 2 members that didn't have the knowledge around web, that is, we learned everything in one night, but our third member already had knowledge in this area and was able to help us. This third member was in charge of dealing with Matter.js, having to learn the entire library and work on the functions that we decided to implement for the 'destruction' of the site.

Accomplishments that we're proud of and what we learned
We are very proud of our work, as we learned a lot while doing it, much more than we would have learned on a normal day of study, making this a much more productive way to learn.

What we learned
HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap, Javascript and Matter.js.

What's next for I hate this website
We decided to leave this project as an aid to develop others further using the properties we learned, taking into account that Matter.js proved to be very useful, so we decided to go further in learning it and build other projects around it.

Built With
Bootstrap5, CSS3, HTML5, Javascript, JQuery, Matter.js
